## Set up AI Provider Configuration

Configure robust AI provider setup with the Vercel AI SDK: $ARGUMENTS

### Current Configuration Analysis

Existing provider setup: !`grep -r "@ai-sdk/" . --include="*.ts" --include="*.tsx" | head -5`

Environment variables: !`grep -r "API_KEY\|_KEY" .env* 2>/dev/null | head -5 || echo "No API keys found in .env files"`

Provider imports: !`grep -r "from '@ai-sdk/" . --include="*.ts" | head -10`

### Configuration Strategy

**Single Provider**: Focus on one provider with optimal configuration
**Multi Provider**: Set up multiple providers with consistent interface
**Fallback**: Implement automatic failover between providers

### Your Task

1. **Analyze current provider setup** and identify improvements needed
2. **Design provider architecture** with proper abstraction layers
3. **Implement configuration management** with environment handling
4. **Set up provider fallback logic** for reliability
5. **Add usage tracking and cost monitoring** for optimization
6. **Create provider health checks** for monitoring
7. **Implement proper error handling** and recovery
8. **Add comprehensive testing** for all providers

### Implementation Requirements

#### Environment Configuration

- Secure API key management
- Environment-specific configurations
- Provider availability detection
- Default provider selection
- Feature flag support for provider switching

#### Provider Abstraction

- Unified interface across all providers
- Model capability mapping
- Feature detection and adaptation
- Consistent error handling
- Performance monitoring integration

#### Fallback and Reliability

- Automatic provider failover
- Health check implementation
- Circuit breaker patterns
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
- Graceful degradation strategies

### Expected Deliverables

1. **Provider configuration system** with environment management
2. **Multi-provider client wrapper** with unified interface
3. **Fallback and health monitoring** implementation
4. **Usage tracking and analytics** system
5. **Cost optimization utilities** for model selection
6. **Testing suite** covering all provider scenarios
7. **Documentation** with setup guides and best practices
